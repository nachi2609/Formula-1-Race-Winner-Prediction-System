# Formula-1-Race-Winner-Prediction-System

A formula 1 winner predction using machine learning

Calulating the likelihood that a race driver will win the grand prix using Neural Network Classifier and Support Vector Machines.

## We have predicted the F1 2019 season race outcomes with Training set from 2010 Formula 1 season.

  •	Make sure to run all the python notebook files in Jupyter Notebook.
  •	Open and run notebook files in given order:
      1.	Data Collection 1.ipnyb
      2.	Data Collection 2.ipnyb
      3.	Data Collection 3.ipnyb
  •	Once the collection .csv are created we will perform the modeling with following scripts and run notebook files in given order:
      1.	Data Modeling 1.ipnyb
      2.	Data Modeling 2.ipnyb
  •	All .csv files are required for analysis.
  •	“.ipnyb” files cover entire code base

Our Alogrithm predicts 14 out of 21 races of the season.

### Used F1 official website and ergast f1 api.
### Used webscrapping and pandas for data collection and datset creation.
